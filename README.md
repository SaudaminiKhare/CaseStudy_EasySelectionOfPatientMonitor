# CaseStudy_EasySelectionOfPatientMonitor

Description
User is a clinical person seeking help about Philips Patient Monitoring equipment. The Philips site to look for equipment is:
https://www.philips.co.in/healthcare/solutions/patient-monitoring/patient-monitoring
However, there are simply too many choices to make there. This project makes it easier to choose one using a Chatbot.
Customers can ask questions in a language thatâ€™s familiar for them. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring_(medicine) to get an idea of the terminology that would be familiar to a customer shopping for patient monitors.
The Chatbot will accept input and give its response on the console. The conversation (sequence of messages) will lead the customer to a purchase-suggestion.
This Chatbot can be easily modified for use in another domain.
